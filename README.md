# SRAM SEU Detector for APEX

A comprehensive system for detecting, analyzing, and predicting Single Event Upsets (SEUs) in SRAM memory caused by cosmic radiation.

## Overview

This project consists of multiple components:
- A Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with SRAM chips, environmental sensors, and GPS
- Two Pico W microcontrollers for distributed data collection
- Machine learning pipeline for analyzing SEU events and anomaly detection
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Historical data visualization
- REST API for integration with external systems

The system collects data on Single-Event Upsets (SEUs) in SRAM memory, such as bit flips, from ground level up to 30 km in altitude, along with environmental parameters (pressure, altitude, temperature) and location. This data is used to train machine learning models that can predict SEU events in real time.

## Installation

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed setup instructions.

Quick start:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/machonach/APEX-SRAM-SEU-Detector
cd seu-detector

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate synthetic data (temporary)
cd ml_pipeline
python SEU-Synthetic-Data-Creator.py

# Run ML pipeline
python SEU-ML-Pipeline.py

# Start dashboard
cd ..
python integrated_dashboard.py
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes automated testing and deployment through a CI/CD pipeline implemented with GitHub Actions. 
The pipeline runs tests, checks code quality, and builds Docker containers for deployment.

See [CI_CD.md](CI_CD.md) for detailed information about the CI/CD setup.

## Results

The system provides insights into SEU occurrences based on altitude, temperature, and cosmic radiation intensity. The machine learning models can predict SEU events with high accuracy based on environmental factors.

## Accessing and Using the Dashboard

The project includes an interactive dashboard for visualizing SEU data, sensor readings, and machine learning predictions.

### Starting the Dashboard

1. Make sure you have installed all dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Generate or collect SEU data (see above for data generation).
3. To launch the dashboard, run:
   ```bash
   python data_visualizer/app.py
   ```
   or, for the integrated dashboard:
   ```bash
   python integrated_dashboard.py
   ```

### Dashboard Features
- **Raw Data Tab:** Visualizes collected SEU and sensor data over time.
- **ML Predictions Tab:**
  - Lets you select the percentage of data used for training the machine learning model.
  - Compares predicted SEU counts to actual values using scatter and time series plots.
  - Shows model performance metrics (MSE, RÂ² score).
- **Interactive Controls:**
  - Use the slider to adjust the training/testing split and see how the model performs on new data.

### Accessing the Dashboard
- By default, the dashboard runs locally at: [http://127.0.0.1:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050/)
- Open this URL in your web browser after starting the dashboard script.

### Custom Data
- The dashboard loads data from CSV files (e.g., `ml_pipeline/seu_synthetic_data.csv`).
- To use your own data, ensure it is in CSV format with columns for timestamp, altitude, temperature, bit flips, etc.

For more details on dashboard usage or troubleshooting, see the [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) and comments in `data_visualizer/app.py`.
